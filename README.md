To Play you will need a keyboard and good reflexes. Just click on the "Star Game" button and the game will begin, be ready!

Once the game has begun, bugs will try to catch you (the blue turret at the bottom) to stop them, type the word on top of them without any mistake. If you mistype one letter you will have to start that word over. 

- The score increases when you shoot a bug
- The lengthier the word the more points you get
- Once you shoot all bugs, more bugs are going to spawn immediately
- The more waves of bugs you survive the more lengthier the words become (more points!)
- If any bug touches you, the game is over
