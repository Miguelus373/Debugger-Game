Once the game has begun, bugs will try to catch you (you are the blue turret at the bottom) to stop them, type the word on top of them with no mistakes. If you mistype one letter you will have to start over with that word. 

- The score increases when you shoot a bug
- The lengthier the word the more points you get
- Once you shoot all bugs, more bugs are going to spawn immediately
- The more waves of bugs you survive the more lengthier the words become (more points!)
- If a bug touches you, the game is over and you will see the Leaderboard
